# react-testing-by-example

Learn testing with plain vanilla, components, hooks and redux by example, each of ones contains a readme.md file that indicates the purpose of the sample plus an step by step guide to reproduce it.

Each example group has a `00-boilerplate` as start point to reproduce others.

As summary, we will need install these dependencies to test it:

```bash
npm install jest @types/jest ts-jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/react-hooks react-test-renderer --save-dev

npm install deep-freeze --save-dev
```
